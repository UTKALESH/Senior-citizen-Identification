# Senior Citizen Identification


This project focuses on developing a **machine learning model** that detects multiple persons in a video (from a file or real-time webcam feed), **predicts their age and gender**, and identifies **senior citizens** (individuals aged 60 and above).

Upon detection, the system automatically **logs** the person's:
- **Predicted Age Group**
- **Gender**
- **Timestamp of Visit**

All detected senior citizens' information is stored in a **CSV file** for record-keeping and further analysis.
